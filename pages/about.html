                    n January 1, 1965, the Ambassador Restaurant opened under
                    new ownership. The new owners, the Rossi family, had
                    transformed the space from a tap bar into a restaurant that
                    specialized in pizza and sandwiches. In 1978, the Ambassador
                    was expanded into the space next door, and the second dining
                    room was added. In January 2007, the Ambassador became a
                    non-smoking establishment. To explain the history of the
                    Ambassador and the unique murals that line the interior
                    walls, the owners conducted research and wrote a poem
                    detailing the story. The poem, entitled "Come Fill a
                    Bumper," has since been printed on the cover of the
                    Ambassador menu. (see below for full text)

                    he first line of the poem mentions "Mr. Rohrbeck," who was
                    “given a job to do.” Rohrbeck, the mural artist, was
                    commissioned by Joseph Bosch (born in Baden, Germany in
                    1850) to paint the murals specifically for the Bosch brewery
                    (closed in 1978). The murals were later placed in the "old
                    Giltedge Bar." Featuring gnomes in various states of
                    celebration, the murals are oil on canvas, with several
                    coats of varnish on top for preservation. The date that the
                    paintings were sold to the Ambassador and transferred from
                    the Bosch Brewery is unclear, but the transaction likely
                    took place in the late 40s or early 50s during a remodeling
                    project.

              On or about nineteen hundred and two, Mr. Rohrbeck was given a job
              to do.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              With brushes in hand and gnomes in his head, he created the
              masterpiece on the wall above.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              First home for the paintings was the old Giltedge Bar, east of
              here, but not too far.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Streets were of dirt, sidewalks of wood, hitching posts for
              horses, business was good.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Beer for a nickel, whiskey for a dime, sandwiches a quarter any
              old time.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Prohibition was next, and became the law, the Ambassador, a
              speakeasy, called “Hole in the Wall”
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Paintings were rolled and stored away, for twelve long years in
              the dust they lay.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              At last came nineteen thirty-three, the law was repealed and
              Bacchus was free.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Saloons and taverns opened their doors, folks danced, sang, and
              drank spirits once more.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              The old bar was hauled out of its storage place, and the paintings
              were hung on the walls they now grace.
            </span>
            <br />
            <span>
              The artist, long gone, would be proud if he knew, that folks still
              enjoy them as much as they do.
